Create a Matching Game

In this project, I build a matching game, where the player must match pairs of hidden icons. 
I learn how to:

- Store objects, such as icons, in a List object.

- Use a foreach loop in Visual C# or a For Each loop in Visual Basic to iterate through items in a list.

- Keep track of a form's state by using reference variables.

- Build an event handler to respond to events that you can use with multiple objects.

- Make a timer that counts down and then fires an event exactly once after being started.
